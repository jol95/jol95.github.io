## PepperonIT
During our master we had a project course were we got the opportunity to work with real companies. The project I was on ended up working for an ideal organization that wanted to spark interest in program in kids, specifically young girls.
The project itself was to further develop a physical robot, Pepper, for the kids to play with. The core of our project was to make the robot block-programmable. Then there was another group focusing on rock-paper-scissors and then my group, web-interactions.

I developed interactions with google, wikipedia and youtube. For the product owner it was very important with having multiple languages available for speech, so my work broadend a bit. I ended up implementing a server that had a model of OpenAI's Whisper running on it, so that pretty much any language could interact with Pepper. This was done via audible interactions with Pepper, where the users speech would be recorded, sent to the server and transcribed, sent back and then executed in whatever manner.

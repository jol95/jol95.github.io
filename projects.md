## PepperonIT
During our master we had a project course were we got the opportunity to work with real companies. The project I was on ended up working for an ideal organization that wanted to spark interest in program in kids, specifically young girls.
The project itself was to further develop a physical robot, Pepper, for the kids to play with. The core of our project was to make the robot block-programmable. Then there was another group focusing on rock-paper-scissors and then my group, web-interactions.

I developed interactions with google, wikipedia and youtube. For the product owner it was very important with having multiple languages available for speech, so my work broadend a bit. I ended up implementing a server that had a model of OpenAI's Whisper running on it, so that pretty much any language could interact with Pepper. This was done via audible interactions with Pepper, where the users speech would be recorded, sent to the server and transcribed, sent back and then executed in whatever manner.

# Coursework

## AI

A course in applied artificial intelligens. It was mainly about gaining an understanding of the implementations of different models and principles.
The excercises was done by me and one other student. The project piece was a larger group.

## Databases

A course in Database techniques. The labs was centered around SQL, and a focus on creating a functional database so the lab was to create a dummy e-commerce site.
The excercises was done by me and one other student.

## Microdata

A course in assembly that was centered around the MIPS-processor. These labs were extremely well done, were we got to implement base operations from scratch, on an increasingly complexity/effiency on the virtual processor.
The excercises was done by myself, and the labs were based on peer-review on gitlab in form the form of issues.

## Dynamic Websystems

A course in dynamic websystems that was centered around a back-end - front-end development with a RESTful API. The task was to create a wind power simulation and display on the site. I worked on the front-end, where the work was done with React as well as some other technologies such as Redux.
The lab was done by me and one other student.

## Candidate project

A project course done 3 years into studies. The task we were given was to simulate a p2p-network with some generated data. The reason behind this was that the product owner had some interest in displaying some machine learning data from self driving vehicles from construction sites. This was meant to be some sort of proof of work, and for us it was only simulated.
The project was done in a larger group, whereas I was in a subgroup, front-end, with two other people.

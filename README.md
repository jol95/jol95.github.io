# Personal site and blog
Just a simple site powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github pages for my own personal use. The idea is to have an accessable site where I can chose to show my current projects, credentials and blog about whatever.

# Credit
Credit for setting up the base of this page goes to Jekyll and it's creator. It's a really easy way of hosting one's website, I'd highly recommend!

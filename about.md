I'm a former CS student that decided that I'd rather get out there and start working rather than finishing my studies. In short, I realized I'd rather spend my time looking for work and to furhter look into different fields and sharpen my programming skills then spend the next year cleaning up math related courses in order to work as a developer. I learnt a lot from my 5 years in school, one such thing is that development and problem sovling is something i enjoy, engineering math and such is not.

### More Information
Born and raised Swedish. I have a passion for gaming, lifting and cooking. Some would say a very steoriotypical guy in his 20's.

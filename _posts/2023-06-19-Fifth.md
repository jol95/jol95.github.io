Creating the base of a containerized stack application

So I've been wanting to start some sort of project to have something additional to show, but I'm still not sure as to what that would be. I feel like I either need to find something that really interests me, or google up some project and stick with it. We'll see what I do later in the week.

The only thing I seem to have decided is creating some sort of fullstack application, as that would allow me to broadly show off something that has several technologies put into it. Ofcouse this would not be the only way, but as fullstack development is a job as well, it makes sense to me. It also made sense to containerize the applications, since docker and kubernetes is broadly used, there's really no downside to it.

It's been even more difficult deciding on which technologies to use. I feel like I need to spend my time wisely, and create something that's seen as useful in different areas. The skeleton of the project I created was with React, FastAPI and Postgre which seems fine. But I've worked with React, as well as python based frameworks (Flask) and SQL databases. But I'm not sure if it's best to double down on it, or create something else. Such as an Angular, expressjs and mongodb stack where I have less experience.

I have no clue at the moment.

Peace
